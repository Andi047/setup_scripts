## Fedora minimal script

* Fedora's KDE spin is quite bloated and has a big chunk of apps you might not use
* My script provides a minimal KDE install on top of a minimal Fedora installation, when executed

1. Install Fedora for Desktop via the *Everything* .iso file without DE
2. Save my script on a USB stick and execute it via CLI on your device
3. The script installs KDE Plasma via the internet connection

## Fedora KDE setup

* Installs various software, inspect script for details

## Neon Setup

* Installs various software (KDE, LibreOffice, Ubuntu restricted extras, other)
* Adds a swap file and changes the swap behaviour to be much less aggressive
* Installs programming languages
